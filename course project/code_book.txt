Codebook

Raw data:
activities labels information taken from activity_labels.txt ("walking", "walkingUpstairs", "walkingDownstairs", "sitting", "standing", "laying")
features which are the names of the columns for x_test and x_train data. The complete list of variables of each feature vector is available in 'features.txt'
test and train data of some users wearing Samsung phone which are taken from X_test.txt and X.train.txt respectively
subject and activity data for each test and train session (subject_test.txt, y_test.txt, subject_train.txt, y_train.txt)

Processed Data:
66 variables contains means and standard deviation filtered from merged x_test and x_train data.frame, angle variable is not included

activity was converted from data taken from activity_labels.txt based on y_test.txt and y_train.txt, and coded as factors
user was coded as factors
value for 66 means and standard deviation are averaged based on each user and each activity
